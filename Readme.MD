# Akka.Persistence.Linq2Db

A Cross-SQL-DBA Akka.Persistence plugin with broad database compatibility thanks to Linq2Db.

This is a Fairly-Naive port of the amazing akka-persistence-jdbc package from Scala to C#. 


#### This is still a WORK IN PROGRESS

 **Pull Requests are Welcome** but please note this is still considered 'work in progress' and only used if one understands the risks. While the TCK Specs pass you should still test in a 'safe' non-production environment carefully before deciding to fully deploy.
 
 Additionally, at this time there is no migration or backward compatibility with past Akka.Persistence SQL providers. The columns themselves should be a good 'fit' with the existing designs for SQLite/SQLServer but full compatibility should not be considered a guarantee (particularly in SQLite due to possible differences in how data is stored). 

## Advantages over `Akka.Contrib.Persistence.Sql.Common` Implementations:

 - Akka.Streams used aggressively to lower blocking overhead
 
 - Linq2Db usage for easier swapping of backend DBs.
 

## Currently Implemented:

- Journal
  - With `JournalSpec` and `JournalPerfSpec` passing for MS SQL Server and Microsoft.Data.SQLite
- Configuration
  - No unit tests yet.
  - Still Lacking Default Configs.

## Incomplete:

- SnapshotStore
- Journal Queries (i.e. Tag queries. Tags are properly persisted at this time.)
 
## Configuration Samples:

### Journal:

Please note that you -must- provide a Connection String and Provider name.

Refer to the Members of `Linq2Db.ProviderName` for included providers.
